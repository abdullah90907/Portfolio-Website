## ü§î What is Gemma 3N?

Gemma 3N is our quantized 3-bit version of Google's Gemma 3B model.  

- It is designed to be **3x smaller in memory** while still maintaining strong accuracy.  
- It can run on **RTX 3060**, **Colab T4**, and even **Apple M1 / M2**!  
- You can also fine-tune Gemma 3N for even better results.  

We call it **3N** (3-bit Normal) because it's a 3-bit quantization of the normal float16 model.

---

## ‚ùì Is there an official 3N from Google?

No.  

- Google only released **Gemma 2B**, **Gemma 7B**, and **Gemma 1.1 9B** (for float16/bfloat16 and int8).  
- There is no **3-bit** official release from Google.  

Our **3N** variant is an **Unsloth** quantization for ultra-low-memory use cases.
