**Celebrating Women's Day: Honoring the Inspirational Women Who Shaped My Journey**

Today, as we celebrate Women's Day, I want to take a moment to reflect on the incredible women who have played a pivotal role in my academic and professional growth. Each of them has left an indelible mark on my journey, and I'm forever grateful for their guidance, support, and inspiration.

## My Mentors and Inspirations

üåü **Mam Wajeeha Azmat** ‚Äì When I started my journey at UAF, coming from a medical background, I was filled with doubts‚Äîcould I really transition into Computer Science? But Mam Wajeeha changed everything. She introduced me to amazing platform **iCodeGuru** and mentors that help in every step. Her support gave me the confidence to keep going, and I'll always be thankful for that.

‚ú® **Mam Hamna Dawood** ‚Äì Before attending her sessions, I used to think that LeetCode was overly complex. But through her teaching method, I not only learned how to approach **Data Structures & Algorithms** but also built confidence to solve problems logically. I still remember that she used to ask everyone in the next class if anyone did not understand the previous session we can again continue it. I even delivered my first LeetCode presentation during her session at iCodeGuru‚Äîan experience that truly marked the beginning of my coding journey.

‚ú® **Mam Hijab Zahra** ‚Äì She shared some of the most insightful knowledge on how to set a roadmap for learning and leveraging **AI tools**. Her advice helped me stay focused and motivated, and I'm so grateful for her guidance.

üìö **Mam Raheela Nasim** ‚Äì Her database lectures were also fascinating for me. She made complex topics easy to understand, and I still use what I learned from her. Her teaching style was truly inspiring.

## My Greatest Inspiration

Lastly, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to **my mother** ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚Äîmy biggest source of inspiration. She has always been my pillar of strength, supporting me through every challenge and milestone.

## Gratitude

A huge thank you to all the amazing women who have contributed to my learning and growth. Your impact is immeasurable!
