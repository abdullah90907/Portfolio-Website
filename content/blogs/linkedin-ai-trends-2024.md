🎓 **6 Weeks of Teaching. A Journey to Remember.** 🌍 

I'm thrilled to share that I've successfully completed my role as a **Section Leader** for Stanford University: Code In Place 2025. This global initiative brings together thousands of learners and volunteer teachers from around the world to explore computer science. 💻🌐

## The Teaching Experience

Over the past 6 weeks, I had the amazing opportunity to teach and mentor a group of dedicated students in their programming journey. Watching them grow each week, solving problems, asking thoughtful questions, and building confidence, was a truly rewarding experience. 🙌

It's hard to believe how quickly this journey came to an end. What started with a simple orientation turned into weeks of engaging sessions, shared learning moments, and meaningful connections. ⏳✨

## Gratitude and Acknowledgments

A heartfelt **thank you** to the Stanford University: Code In Place team for organizing such a powerful and global learning platform, and for giving us the chance to be part of it. 🙏

I'm also deeply grateful to:
- **iCodeGuru**
- **Sir Zafar Shahid, PhD**
- **Sir Rizwan Ghaffar**

For their constant support, encouragement, and motivation throughout this journey. 👨‍🏫❤️

## Looking Forward

This experience has strengthened my passion for teaching and reminded me of the impact we can make by sharing what we know. Looking forward to more opportunities to give back, grow, and inspire others. 🚀
