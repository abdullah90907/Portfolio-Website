**🌌 Transforming Healthcare with AI: Our Hackathon Experience 💎**

I’m thrilled to share my experience from the **Gen AI Build with AI Hackathon**, where I teamed up with a group of passionate innovators to develop **LungLens**—an AI-powered tool designed to make chest X-ray diagnostics more accessible and understandable for patients.

This project was more than just a prototype—it was a glimpse into how **Generative AI** can assist in modern healthcare with real-world impact.

## 🩺 What is LungLens?

**LungLens** is a medical AI tool built to support patients and healthcare professionals by analyzing **chest X-rays** using deep learning models. Here's what it offers:

**➡ Probability Graphs**  
Visual graphs predict the likelihood of common chest-related conditions, including:
- **Pneumonia**
- **Lung nodules**
- **Cardiomegaly**

**➡ AI Health Chatbot**  
A built-in conversational assistant acts like a **personal medical consultant**, capable of answering basic health queries and providing context-aware information for patients—no medical background required.

While LungLens is still in development and not 100% accurate yet, it demonstrates the **potential of AI to democratize healthcare**. Our focus remains on continuous improvement and safety in future iterations.
