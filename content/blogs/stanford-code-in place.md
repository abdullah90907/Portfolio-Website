**🎓 6 Weeks of Teaching. A Journey to Remember. 🌍**

I'm beyond excited to share the completion of my role as a **Section Leader** for **Stanford University's Code In Place 2025**—a global, volunteer-led initiative that brings thousands of learners and teachers together to explore the world of **computer science**.

Over the past 6 weeks, I had the privilege of teaching and mentoring a group of enthusiastic, committed students through the fundamentals of programming. Watching them learn to think like programmers—solving problems, asking meaningful questions, and growing week by week—was both humbling and inspiring. 💡💻

## 🌐 What This Journey Meant

What started with an orientation quickly evolved into a journey of shared discovery, virtual classrooms full of curiosity, and a bond between learners from all over the world. These six weeks flew by, but the memories, lessons, and energy will stay with me.

**👩‍🏫 A Global Effort in Teaching**  
Code In Place isn’t just a course—it’s a movement. Created by Stanford faculty and powered by volunteers worldwide, it embodies the idea that learning should be accessible to everyone.

**📈 Watching Growth Happen**  
Each session brought new challenges, and with every one of them, I saw my students become more confident and capable. From printing “Hello, world” to writing functional Python programs, their progress was incredible.

**💬 Shared Learning Moments**  
Some of the most powerful parts of the journey weren’t just about code—they were the meaningful questions, peer encouragement, and aha-moments that happened in between.

## 🌱 Looking Forward

This journey has deepened my belief in the **power of teaching** and the impact of sharing knowledge. It reminded me that even the smallest effort to help someone understand something better can create a ripple of change.

I'm looking forward to continuing this mission—giving back, teaching more, and staying committed to lifelong learning and mentorship. 🚀
