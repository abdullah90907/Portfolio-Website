**🎉 Thrilled to Announce the Completion of Our AI & ML Journey at iCodeGuru!**

After 8 intensive weeks of learning and building, I’m excited to share the successful conclusion of our **AI and Machine Learning program** at **iCodeGuru**—a journey filled with growth, innovation, and real-world application.

One of the proudest accomplishments from this experience was the development of a **real-time video object detection system**, a project that pushed me to apply AI beyond theory and create something truly impactful.

## 🎯 Project Highlight

Using a **YOLO-based pre-trained model**, I built a system capable of processing video input, identifying objects frame by frame, and producing a variety of meaningful outputs.

**🔍 CSV Export of Detection Results**  
The system logs detailed detection data into a CSV file—including object names, positions, and confidence scores—making it easy to perform custom analysis or track results over time.

**🎥 Annotated Video Output**  
Each processed video features bounding boxes and labels for objects detected in real time, offering a clear and intuitive visual experience.

**📊 Analytical Graphs**  
To provide deeper insights, the system generates custom graphs that display detection frequency, object types, and confidence levels.

**⚙️ Model Enhancements**  
Though built on a pre-trained YOLO architecture, I fine-tuned the model to:
- Improve accuracy in long videos  
- Optimize runtime performance  
- Enhance detection stability in complex scenes
