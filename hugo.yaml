          I served as a Section Leader at [Stanford Code in Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/), where I had the opportunity to teach and mentor students from around the world in Python programming. It was an amazing experience to guide global participants, help them understand key programming concepts, and watch them grow through hands-on coding exercises.

          - Led weekly coding sessions and provided one-on-one support to students.
          - Explained core programming topics in simple ways to help beginners build confidence.
          - Reviewed assignments and gave feedback to support student learning.
